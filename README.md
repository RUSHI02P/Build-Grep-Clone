[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
(Regexes, for short) are patterns used to match character combinations in
strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for
searching using Regexes.

In this I've build an implementation of `grep`. Along the way
i've learn about Regex syntax, how parsers/lexers work, and how regular
expressions are evaluated.

To run locally, please follow these steps.
1. Ensure you have `mvn` installed locally
2. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main/java/Main.java`.
